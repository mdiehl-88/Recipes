# Smoked Queso Dip
## Ingredients
- 1 block Velveeta
- 8 oz Monterry Jack Cheese
- 2 cans Rotel
- 1 can Cream of Mushroom Soup
- 1/2 White Onion, diced
- 1 lb Hot Pork Sausage, cooked
- 1 diced jalape√±o
- 1 tbsp BBQ Rub of your Choice

## Methods
1. Preheat your smoker to 350 degrees F. Note: If your smoker is already on, this can be cooked at any temperature but may take longer (or shorter) depending on the temperature. 
2. Add all ingredients above into a large, grill safe pan. I prefer to use the throwaway foil pans. 
3. Place on the smoker, stirring every 10 minutes until the dip is fully melted.
